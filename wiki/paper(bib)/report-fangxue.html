<h2 id="academic-dishonesty-problems-in-universities-and-colleges">1. Academic Dishonesty Problems in Universities and Colleges</h2>
<p>Academic misconduct has been a problem for universities and colleges <span class="citation" data-cites="1 3"></span>. Students can fool markers to get a grade they don’t deserve. This is also a big problem for many researchers that some of them may create unoriginal works. More importantly, these behaviors can be addictive after they become aware of the “benefits”, which leads to more ghostwriting. <span class="citation" data-cites="9"></span> point out that the situation is not optimistic in China, so <span class="citation" data-cites="1"></span> believe that solutions are urgently needed.</p>
<p>As we all know, artificial intelligence (AI) is developing quickly. Moreover, it has dabbled in academic integrity issues. The affects lie in two aspects: AI-writing and AI plagiarism-detecting.</p>
<h2 id="ai-writing-threats-academic-integrity">2. AI-Writing Threats Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>AI-writing not only misleads students but also aggravates academic dishonesty. <span class="citation" data-cites="6"></span> points out that essay mills help students write academic essays and have earned a lot of money. Equipped with AI, they seem to be more activated. As for researchers, <span class="citation" data-cites="2"></span> describe that a scholar called Ike Antkare is cited even more than A. Einstein because he generated hundreds of publications with using AI. According to <span class="citation" data-cites="2"></span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="4"></span>, text generator called GPT-2 is considered too &quot;dangerous&quot; because it creates realistic and coherent texts. It seems that academic integrity is facing unprecedented challenge.</p>
<h2 id="ai-can-detect-plagiarism">3. AI Can Detect Plagiarism</h2>
<p>But with the aid of AI, academic plagiarism detection is also benefited a lot. On the one hand, computer checking is far more efficient and less time-consuming than manual detection, especially for a large number of documents <span class="citation" data-cites="1 3"></span>. On the other hand, AI makes detecting systems more smart. Computers are now gaining insight into complex linguistic phenomena. Thus, they are not only comparing texts with existing sources, but also analyzing the meaning and some vocabulary changes <span class="citation" data-cites="1 9"></span>. In other words, they can identify more tricky plagiarisms.</p>
<p>But it is far from complete triumph. The competition between academic misconduct and detection is still going on. In this review, we’ll talk about features of AI ghostwriting, AI plagiarism-detecting, and some future advice.</p>
<h1 id="ai-ghostwriting-in-academic-life">. AI Ghostwriting in Academic Life</h1>
<p>With AI developing quickly, AI writer has been widely used. However, some people are using AI in ghostwriting. AI writers are so productive and efficient that it might cause more severe academic dishonesty. Some people also proposed ethical issues that are worth considering.</p>
<h2 id="accessibility-of-ai-ghostwriting">1. Accessibility of AI Ghostwriting</h2>
<p>AI-writing is universally available. One can find online writers which generate texts according to inputted keywords. Some of them claim that they are using AI algorithms. <span class="citation" data-cites="2"></span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="4"></span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="5"></span> all present that most AI-writers are free. <span class="citation" data-cites="4"></span> even believes that AI-writers will spread because of open source softwares, which implies anyone can copy the codes to use. AI is so widely used to generate texts and even a few research articles. <span class="citation" data-cites="2"></span> reviewed a lot of AI applications in academic circle, which includes to summarize previous studies and to generate publications. These tools could be a challenge to academic integrity.</p>
<p>But the more serious problem is that requirement for ghostwriting is still large. <span class="citation" data-cites="6"></span> discovers that &quot;millions of university students worldwide keep paying essay mills to write their academic papers&quot;. Another situation is that the number of published paper is an important index in Chinese institutions of higher education. The main reasons why people choose to cheat are that graduates have to publish many research articles to get a degree and faculty members do the same to gain a higher professional title <span class="citation" data-cites="9"></span>. Despite strict rules, the motivator of academic dishonesty always exists.</p>
<p>In all, as <span class="citation" data-cites="6"></span> illustrates, modern technologies like AI offer a chance for students to cheat more easily.</p>
<h2 id="strengths-and-weaknesses-of-ai-ghostwriting">2. “Strengths and Weaknesses” of AI Ghostwriting</h2>
<p>Computers have a very high efficiency when doing repetitive jobs. As described by <span class="citation" data-cites="2"></span>, they generate hundreds of papers in few hours. An extreme example is that Philip Parker “wrote” 200,000 books, every twenty minutes each. That is really scary.</p>
<p>AI-writings have an improved quality <span class="citation" data-cites="2 5"></span>. They can paraphrase original texts and organize the article into proper structures. These are required for students when writing. Such progresses make it harder to directly distinguish AI-generated articles from those written by students <span class="citation" data-cites="2"></span>.</p>
<p>However, researchers also points out their defects. <span class="citation" data-cites="2"></span> note that some of them are not logical or coherent, thus they are identified once read in depth by people. What’s more, an assignment at college needs a student to summarize and draw meaningful conclusion, but <span class="citation" data-cites="5"></span> observed that AI-generated articles might have no actual meaning for readers.</p>
<p>To conclude, AI finish an assignment effortlessly but the articles are still not perfect in some advanced requirements. But we still have to pay attention to potential risks when technologies advance and they can write really well.</p>
<h2 id="ethical-issues-on-ai-ghostwriting">3. Ethical Issues on AI Ghostwriting</h2>
<p>Some people also proposed ethical issues on AI-writing, which is also closely related to academic integrity.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="4"></span> asks a few questions on what is &quot;original&quot;. We consider an article written by AI not &quot;original&quot;. However, it is hard to decide when the AI program is created by the article &quot;author&quot; him/herself. We are no sure if these &quot;indirectly written&quot; works belong to the author’s intelligence or the AI’s. Furthermore, <span class="citation" data-cites="5"></span> worries about AI which controls human, since AI might edit a work without authorization of the “author” when helping to write.</p>
<p>These moral and ethical problems have exceeded the technology field <span class="citation" data-cites="6"></span>. In fact, the answers depend on the definition of academic integrity concepts. They might be a research gap now. We have to think about them before they occur in our real life.</p>
<h1 id="ai-facilitated-plagiarism-detection">. AI-Facilitated Plagiarism Detection</h1>
<p>AI can also be a useful tool for detecting plagiarism. Researchers like <span class="citation" data-cites="1"></span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="4"></span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="5"></span> suggest applying smart or intelligent technology. <span class="citation" data-cites="6"></span> also confirms AI can be an assistant for school, college and university teachers.</p>
<h2 id="ai-plagiarism-detecting-advantages">1. AI-Plagiarism-Detecting Advantages</h2>
<p>Compared to common computers which only define similarity of texts and sources, AI detectors has the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They compare figures easily <span class="citation" data-cites="1 9"></span>. Artificial intelligence have specific sub-disciplines like Image Recognition. They can help computers quickly find out similar graphs in two articles.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="citation" data-cites="1"></span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="9"></span> also indicate they can detect cross-language plagiarism. Some people translate a source to copy it and pretend the text is &quot;original&quot;. Another AI technique, Neural Machine Translation can be useful to solve this problem.</p></li>
<li><p>They can also figure out students’ writing styles <span class="citation" data-cites="6 8"></span>. They just need a few of a students’ work to extract language-use habits before judging if some texts are written by this student.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of researches have been conducted in those areas. Thus, <span class="citation" data-cites="3"></span> thinks some easy features could be effortlessly detected. <span class="citation" data-cites="6"></span> also believes their product Emma prevents students from cheating effectively. In fact, the detectors may have contributed to reduce plagiarism. According to &quot;Google trend&quot;, search frequency of &quot;article generation&quot; was going up from 2004 for 10 years while it fell after 2014. This could be due to the development of the AI detection tools <span class="citation" data-cites="2"></span>, which to some extent helps to ease academic misconduct.</p>
<h2 id="ai-detecting-has-a-long-way-to-go">2. AI-Detecting Has a Long Way to Go</h2>
<p>More importantly, we must understand that the detectors are not intelligent enough. <span class="citation" data-cites="1"></span> conclude that none of the detectors can solve everything. As stated in the Section , academic plagiarism is far from ending.</p>
<p>An emerging problem is that AI writings have different characteristics from simple plagiarism. Detectors have to figure them out in the future <span class="citation" data-cites="5"></span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="4"></span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="5"></span> believe the technological race is likely to begin. <span class="citation" data-cites="2"></span> worry that AI-writers might get stronger to beat the anti-plagiarism systems, while <span class="citation" data-cites="4"></span> states that nobody knows the result, and moreover, how people will view academic integrity is certainly going to be changed.</p>
<p>To sum up, AI plagiarism detectors are great tools but still need further development before wiping out plagiarism in academic circle.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">. Conclusion</h1>
<p>AI writing will progress day by day, both in writing and detecting, which will add to novel issues for academic integrity. Things are getting more complicated. It might be long before we find the answer.</p>
<p>Here is some advice for the future:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Deal with related plagiarism fundamentally</strong></p>
<p>Teachers should firstly take measures to reduce academic misconduct. <span class="citation" data-cites="3"></span> suggests making rules on academic integrity; <span class="citation" data-cites="2"></span> regard it as a solution to assign tasks that students cannot cheat, but it is unclear what these tasks are. As another point of view, <span class="citation" data-cites="6"></span> advises teachers to keep students motivated in learning in order to prevent cheating. He concentrates more on education itself. When students study happily and actively, they would probably not cheat.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Develop effective plagiarism detectors</strong></p>
<p>Because people always has motivatorsfor cheating, we can control it only under strict rules. However, the effect depends on whether unoriginal works can be detected. If detectors are perfect, students will hardly cheat <span class="citation" data-cites="6"></span>. AI-detecting tools might be solutions to plagiarism in the future <span class="citation" data-cites="4"></span>. But <span class="citation" data-cites="6"></span> believes that it is difficult for plagiarism detectors to detect all plagiarism works by now.</p>
<p>There will be a lot of research to be done. Firstly, <span class="citation" data-cites="1"></span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="9"></span> points out that AI must <strong>gain deeper recognition and understanding into human language</strong>. Scientists are going to intensively study techniques such as similarity detection, semantic detection and AI translator. They also imply that we have to <strong>develop other relevant techniques</strong>. Database technology needs perfecting and huge database system should be set up. Without a full collection of sources, detectors may leave out some stolen sentences or paragraphs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Properly use AI</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, <span class="citation" data-cites="5"></span> argues that people should think about ethical issues as soon as possible. Applied sciences has been exploding in the past decades. Technology does not possibly decline. There is the possibility in the future that we can never distinguish between AI writings and human writings. Maybe AI writing will be limited to prevent its mistaken use in cheating academic integrity. In comparison, AI plagiarism detectors is helpful for maintaining academic integrity. Scientists could make their effort to build smarter detectors so that plagiarism could be eliminated at an early date.</p></li>
