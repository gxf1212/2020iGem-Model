abstract = {Harmful cyanobacterial blooms have caused serious threat to the sustainable development of freshwater ecosystems due to eutrophication, but there is no consensus on nutrients threshold for controlling cyanobacterial bloom. A Monod-based ratio-dependent model was originally developed to investigate the effects of the extracellular substrate-to-biomass (Chlorophyll a) ratio (S ex /X) on the growth kinetics of Cyanobacteria and to determine the concentration thresholds of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the form of S ex /X. The results indicated that biomass growth was completely suppressed at S ex /X ≤ 0.21 $\mu$g $\mu$g −1 for P and S ex /X ≤ 2.82 $\mu$g $\mu$g −1 for N, which are far lower than the values of most of the eutrophic freshwater lakes. This indicates that in addition to curbing N and P nutrients of eutrophic water, to conduct some biologically mediated changes and to find a suitable environmental fate or a suitable position for excessive N and P nutrients is also of great significance in controlling HABs.},

abstract = {A terrestrial cyanobacterium, Nostoc sp. HK-01, is a candidate material for introduction to extraterrestrial environments, such as Mars, given its high tolerance to drought and other extraterrestrial environments. Here, we evaluated Nostoc sp. HK-01 as food for future habitation of Mars. We found that wet colonies of Nostoc sp. HK-01 after initiation survived for over 8 years on Martian regolith simulant (MRS), although they did not survive for over 105 days on medium without MRS. Total protein per 100 g of the dried colony of Nostoc sp. HK-01 was approximately 50 g. Increases in biomass proliferation in liquid or on agar medium were determined in six strains of terrestrial cyanobacteria, including Nostoc sp. HK-01, N. commune HK-02, N. commune YK-04, N. punctiforme ATCC 29133, Brasilonema sp. HK-05 and Calothrix sp. HK-06. Nostoc sp. HK-01 grew better compared to the other five strains under both conditions. Following the incubation of Nostoc sp. HK-01, the medium exhibited radical-scavenging activity. Sugar content in the medium after a 1-day incubation of Nostoc sp. HK-01 was one-sixth of its dry weight at initiation. These results indicate that, after liquid incubation, the remaining cells may be used as recyclable materials on Mars.},

abstract = {Biological soil crusts (BSC), known as ‘desert ecosystem engineer', play an important role in the restoration and stability maintenance of desert vegetation. BSC microbial communities are the main components of their functions. They participate in the formation of BSC, the improvement of soil physiochemical properties, the stability of soil aggregates and the development of vegetation. In the early stage, due to the limitation of technical methods, the mechanism of how BSC microbial communities regulate the stability of desert vegetation is unclear. However, with the rapid development of soil microbiome technologies in recent years, the research on the composition and function of BSC microbial communities has made great progress, and the contribution of BSC microbial communities to desert ecosystem has a clearer understanding. In this paper, the compositional structure of bacterial, fungal and archaeal communities and their potential functional changes in the carbon and nitrogen cycles during BSC succession in temperate desert are reviewed. Additionally, the soil environmental factors affecting the structure and function of microbial communities are summarized, and the successional model of interaction between different BSC microbial groups and soil physiochemical properties is explained. These results help us to clarify the mechanism of BSC promoting the improvement of desert soil conditions, and to provide theoretical basis for understanding the restoration process of desert vegetation and the contribution of temperate desert ecosystems to the world.},

abstract = {The cyanobiont of Cycas circinalis (identified as Nostoc sp.) was isolated and its heterotrophic metabolism was studied in free culture under nitrogen-fixing conditions. Morphology, growth rate, nitrogenase activity, biochemical composition, efficiency of assimilation of organic carbon and molecular nitrogen were determined under different conditions of energy and carbon supply. The study has revealed the high potential of the heterotrophic metabolism in this symbiotic cyanobacterium. Although low rates of metabolic activities were attained under heterotrophic conditions, the efficiencies of organic carbon utilization (0.48 g cell-carbon per g glucose-carbon in chemoheterotrophy, from 0.65 to 0.74 under photoheterotrophy) and of N2 assimilation (35.0 mg N2 fixed per g glucose used in chemoheterotrophy, from 58.3 to 61.9 under photoheterotrophy) displayed by this organism were among the highest ever found in diazotrophically grown microorganisms. The isolate from C. circinalis was able to grow indefinitely in the dark under nitrogen-fixing conditions, maintaining a well balanced biosynthetic activity and the capacity to resume photosynthetic metabolism quickly. The significance of the heterotrophic potential of this symbiotic Nostoc is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {We present redirection of electron flow to more efficient proton pumping branches within respiratory chains as a generally applicable metabolic engineering strategy, which tailors microbial metabolism to the specific requirements of high cell density processes by improving product and biomass yields. For the example of riboflavin production by Bacillus subtilis, we reduced the rate of maintenance metabolism by about 40{\%} in a cytochrome bd oxidase knockout mutant. Since the putative Yth and the caa3 oxidases were of minor importance, the most likely explanation for this improvement is translocation of two protons per transported electron via the remaining cytochrome aa3 oxidase, instead of only one proton via the bd oxidase. The reduction of maintenance metabolism, in turn, significantly improved the yield of recombinant riboflavin and B. subtilis biomass in fed-batch cultures. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 is considered a microorganism with the potential to generate sustainable hydrogen in the future. However, few kinetic models are capable of simulating different phases of Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 from growth to hydrogen production. In the present study four models are constructed to simulate Cyanothece sp. batch photoproduction process. A dynamic optimisation method is used to determine parameters in the models. It is found that although the piecewise models fit experimental data better, large deviation can be induced when they are used to simulate a process whose operating conditions are different from the current experiments. The modified models are eventually selected in the present study to simulate a two-stage continuous photoproduction process. The current simulation results show that a plug flow reactor (PFR) shows worse performance compared to a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) in the current operating conditions since it lowers the total hydrogen production. The finding is that nitrate and oxygen concentration change along the direction of culture movement in PFR, and hydrogen is only generated in the zone where both of them are low. The reactor area thereby is not well utilised. Additionally, as hydrogen production rate is primarily influenced by biomass concentration, which increases initially and decreases eventually along the direction of culture movement, the overall hydrogen production rate in a PFR may be lower than that in a CSTR. Finally, in this study fed-batch photoproduction processes are proposed containing only one photobioreactor based on the current simulation.},
